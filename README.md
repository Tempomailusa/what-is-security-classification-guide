## 🚀 Why This Guide Matters (Read This First)

Security Classification is **not just bureaucracy** — it is the backbone of:
- National security
- Controlled information sharing
- Preventing accidental disclosures
- Legal & operational compliance

This guide explains **what Security Classification Guides (SCGs) are**, **why they exist**, **how they work**, and **how their principles apply beyond government** — even to businesses and personal data protection.

👉 Learn how **clear classification saves lives, missions, and trust**.

---

## 📘 What Is a Security Classification Guide (SCG)?

A **Security Classification Guide (SCG)** is the official playbook that defines:

- 🔐 What information must be classified  
- 📊 What classification level applies  
- 🏷️ How information must be marked  
- 📤 How it can be shared  
- ⏳ When it can be declassified  

SCGs eliminate guesswork by turning **high-level policy into clear, repeatable rules** that everyone follows consistently.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of a Security Classification Guide

SCGs exist to:
- Prevent **under-classification** (dangerous exposure)
- Prevent **over-classification** (unnecessary secrecy)
- Enable secure collaboration
- Reduce audit & compliance risk

They convert abstract policy into **program-level instructions** that derivative classifiers can safely apply every day.

---

## 🇺🇸 Why SCGs Are Essential for National Security

SCGs protect national interests by ensuring sensitive information:
- Doesn’t leak unintentionally
- Is shared only with authorized recipients
- Is marked and handled consistently

Without SCGs, organizations face:
- Inconsistent markings
- Mission delays
- Increased disclosure risk

> **Strong classification = controlled power**

---

## ⚖️ Classification Challenges & Oversight

Authorized holders can challenge questionable classifications under policies such as **Executive Order 13526**.

<details>
<summary><strong>📌 Why classification challenges matter</strong></summary>

- Prevent unnecessary secrecy  
- Enable lawful transparency  
- Improve long-term trust  
- Strengthen accountability  

Formal and informal challenge processes exist to correct misclassification.
</details>

---

## 🧩 How SCGs Create Consistency

SCGs promote uniformity through:
- Standardized subject lists
- Clear examples & decision tables
- Marking templates
- Handling caveats
- Audit & review cycles

This replaces subjective judgment with **repeatable logic**.

---

## 🔐 Classification Levels Explained

| Level | Disclosure Impact | Handling Requirement |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|
| **Top Secret** | Exceptionally grave damage | Strict access, secure facilities |
| **Secret** | Serious damage | Controlled dissemination |
| **Confidential** | Damage | Limited distribution |

Each level is tied to **impact-based harm**, not convenience.

---

## 🧱 What Does an SCG Contain?

A complete SCG includes:
- Scope & applicability
- Classified subject lists
- Classification rationales
- Marking examples
- Dissemination limits (NOFORN, ORCON)
- Downgrading & declassification rules

These elements ensure **lifecycle control**, not just labeling.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Who Is the Original Classification Authority (OCA)?

The **Original Classification Authority (OCA)** is legally empowered to:
- Make original classification decisions
- Approve SCGs
- Define classification duration
- Ensure policy compliance

### Common OCA Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|----|---------------|
| Agency Head | Final SCG approval |
| Program Manager | Draft & technical justification |
| Subject Expert | Impact & risk analysis |

---

## 🧾 How Derivative Classifiers Use SCGs

Derivative classifiers:
- Apply SCG rules to new documents
- Preserve source justification
- Use the **highest applicable classification**
- Consult OCAs when guidance is unclear

<details>
<summary><strong>✅ Best Practices</strong></summary>

- Track source lineage  
- Never downgrade without authority  
- Apply markings consistently  
- Document decisions  
</details>

---

## 🧠 How SCGs Prevent Unauthorized Disclosure

SCGs reduce risk by combining:
- Explicit markings
- Access controls
- Handling caveats
- Training & audits

### Practical Protection Checklist
- ✔ Proper labeling
- ✔ Need-to-know enforcement
- ✔ Secure storage & transmission
- ✔ Periodic reviews

---

## 📜 Policies Governing SCGs

Security Classification Guides operate under:
- Executive Order 13526
- Departmental manuals (e.g., DoD 5200.01)
- Records & declassification oversight frameworks

These ensure **lawful protection, not arbitrary secrecy**.

---

## 🌍 Applying Classification Principles Beyond Government

The same principles work for:
- Businesses
- Startups
- Individuals

### Core Lessons
- Classify data by sensitivity
- Minimize retention
- Control access
- Automate deletion

This is where **privacy tools** matter.

---

## 🔐 Privacy Meets Classification (Modern Application)

For everyday digital safety:
- Use disposable identifiers
- Avoid long-term exposure
- Reduce data aggregation
- Eliminate unnecessary retention

That’s exactly why **temporary email services** exist.
